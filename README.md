# Technical Documentation Page

This is my solution to third project of Responsive Web Design Certification at [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/)

## 🚀 Starting

This project is a technical documentation page, following the requirements of Responsive Web Design certification at Freecodecamp Website. I built it in HTML, CSS and used Javascript to add some features related to responsive hamburger menu.
