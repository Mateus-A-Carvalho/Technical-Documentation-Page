          JavaScript, born in the mid-1990s, emerged as a pivotal scripting language, forever altering the landscape of web development. Conceived by Brendan Eich at Netscape, it aimed to bring interactivity to static HTML pages. Introduced in 1995 alongside Netscape Navigator 2.0, JavaScript initially faced skepticism but quickly gained traction.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Despite its name similarity with Java, the two languages share little more than syntax. JavaScript's strength lies in its ability to run directly in web browsers, enabling client-side scripting for dynamic content. Its early implementations by Netscape and Microsoft led to fragmentation, but standardization efforts, particularly the ECMAScript specification, sought to harmonize the language.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          As the internet burgeoned, JavaScript's significance soared. Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) became a game-changer, allowing seamless data exchange with servers, transforming user experiences. The rise of dynamic websites, single-page applications, and modern frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue.js underscore JavaScript's enduring relevance.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Node.js, introduced in 2009, extended JavaScript to server-side development, fostering a unified language stack. With the advent of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), JavaScript embraced modern features, enhancing its expressiveness and developer-friendliness.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          JavaScript's ubiquitous presence on the web, coupled with its adaptability and an ever-growing ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, solidifies its role as an indispensable tool in contemporary software development. From interactive web pages to robust server-side applications, JavaScript's journey epitomizes its evolution from a humble browser scripting language to a linchpin in the digital realm.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Here are some reasons to start programming with Javascript in 2024

      <header>
        <h1 class="main-section-heading">A "Hello world!" example</h1>
      </header>

      <article>
        
        <p class="paragraph">
          JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As your JavaScript skills grow, your websites will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          However, getting comfortable with JavaScript is more challenging than getting comfortable with HTML and CSS. You may have to start small, and progress gradually. To begin, let's examine how to add JavaScript to your page for creating a Hello world! example. (Hello world! is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">standard for introductory programming examples.</a>)
        </p>        

        <ol class="list">

          <li class="list__Item">
            Go to your test site and create a new folder named scripts. Within the <code class="inline-code">scripts</code> folder, create a new text document called <code>main.js</code>, and save it.
          </li>

          <li class="list__Item">
            In your index.html file, enter this code on a new line, just before the closing &lt;body&gt; tag:
            <code class="block-code">
              &lt;script src="scripts/main.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
            </code>
          </li>

          <li class="list__Item">
            This is doing the same job as the &lt;link&gt; element for CSS. It applies the JavaScript to the page, so it can have an effect on the HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else on the page).
          </li>

          <li class="list__Item">
            Add this code to the <code class="inline-code">main.js</code> file:
            <code>
              const myHeading = document.querySelector("h1");
              myHeading.textContent = "Hello world!";
            </code>
          </li>

          <li class="list__Item">
            Make sure the HTML and JavaScript files are saved. Then load <code class="inline-code">index.html</code> in your browser. You should see something like this:
          </li>
        </ol>

        <img src="./assets/img/hello-world-img.jpg" alt="">

      </article>
    </section>

    <!-- Section Three -->
    <section id="header_text" class="main-section">

      <header>
        <h1 class="main-header-section">What happened?</h1>
      </header>

      <p class="paragraph">
        The heading text changed to <em>Hello world!</em> using JavaScript. You did this by using a function called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector">querySelector()</a> to grab a reference to your heading, and then store it in a variable called <code class="inline-code">myHeading</code>. This is similar to what we did using CSS selectors. When you want to do something to an element, you need to select it first.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        Following that, the code set the value of the <code class="inline-code">myHeading</code> variable's textContent property (which represents the content of the heading) to Hello world!.
      </p>

    </section>
      
    <!-- Section Four -->
    <section id="header_text" class="main-section">

      <header>
        <h1 class="main-heading-section">Variables</h1>
      </header>

      <p class="paragraph">
        You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Identifier">identifiers</a>, conform to certain rules.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        A JavaScript identifier usually starts with a letter, underscore (<code class="inline-code">_</code>), or dollar sign (<code class="inline-code">$</code>). Subsequent characters can also be digits (<code class="inline-code">0</code> – <code class="inline-code">9</code>). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters <code class="inline-code">A</code> through <code class="inline-code">Z</code> (uppercase) as well as <code class="inline-code">a</code> through <code class="inline-code">z</code> (lowercase).
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        You can use most Unicode letters such as <code class="inline-code">å</code> and <code class="inline-code">ü</code> in identifiers. (For more details, see the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#identifiers">lexical grammar</a> reference.) You can also use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#string_literals">Unicode escape sequences</a> to represent characters in identifiers.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        Some examples of legal names are:
      </p>

      <ul class="list">

        <li class="list__item"><code class="inline-code">Number_hits</code></li>
        <li class="list__item"><code class="inline-code">temp99</code></li>
        <li class="list__item"><code class="inline-code">$credit</code></li>
        <li class="list__item"><code class="inline-code">_name</code></li>
        
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section id="header_text" class="main-section">
      <header></header>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <code></code>
      <li>
        <a href="" class="nav-link"></a>
      </li>
