          JavaScript, born in the mid-1990s, emerged as a pivotal scripting language, forever altering the landscape of web development. Conceived by Brendan Eich at Netscape, it aimed to bring interactivity to static HTML pages. Introduced in 1995 alongside Netscape Navigator 2.0, JavaScript initially faced skepticism but quickly gained traction.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Despite its name similarity with Java, the two languages share little more than syntax. JavaScript's strength lies in its ability to run directly in web browsers, enabling client-side scripting for dynamic content. Its early implementations by Netscape and Microsoft led to fragmentation, but standardization efforts, particularly the ECMAScript specification, sought to harmonize the language.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          As the internet burgeoned, JavaScript's significance soared. Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) became a game-changer, allowing seamless data exchange with servers, transforming user experiences. The rise of dynamic websites, single-page applications, and modern frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue.js underscore JavaScript's enduring relevance.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Node.js, introduced in 2009, extended JavaScript to server-side development, fostering a unified language stack. With the advent of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), JavaScript embraced modern features, enhancing its expressiveness and developer-friendliness.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          JavaScript's ubiquitous presence on the web, coupled with its adaptability and an ever-growing ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, solidifies its role as an indispensable tool in contemporary software development. From interactive web pages to robust server-side applications, JavaScript's journey epitomizes its evolution from a humble browser scripting language to a linchpin in the digital realm.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Here are some reasons to start programming with Javascript in 2024
        </p>
        
        <ul class="list">

          <li class="list__item">
            Industry Standard for Web Development: JavaScript continues to be the backbone of web development, making it a crucial skill in 2024. Its widespread use in building interactive and dynamic web applications ensures its relevance, with no signs of diminishing demand.
          </li>
          <li class="list__item">
            Expanding Use in Full-Stack Development:
            JavaScript's versatility extends to server-side development with technologies like Node.js. Embracing JavaScript for both front-end and back-end tasks simplifies the full-stack development process, providing a unified language experience.
          </li>
          <li class="list__item">
            Evolving ECMAScript Standards:
            The ECMAScript standards, guiding the development of JavaScript, constantly evolve. Staying current with the latest standards, such as ES2024, ensures that developers can leverage modern language features, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
          </li>
          <li class="list__item">
            Robust Ecosystem of Libraries and Frameworks:
            The JavaScript ecosystem boasts a wealth of libraries and frameworks, aiding developers in building scalable and efficient applications. Popular tools like React, Angular, and Vue.js continue to evolve, offering new features and improved developer experiences.
          </li>
          <li class="list__item">
            Growing Community and Resources:
            JavaScript's vibrant global community remains a valuable asset. With an expansive network of developers, forums, and online resources, learning and problem-solving become more accessible. Engaging with this community opens doors to collaboration and continuous learning opportunities in 2024.

      </header>
      <article>

        <h2 class="sub-heading__section">Basic</h2>

        <p class="paragraph">
          This section discusses JavaScript's basic grammar, variable declarations, data types and literals.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          JavaScript is <strong>case-sensitive</strong> and uses the <strong>Unicode</strong> character set. For example, the word Fr端h (which means "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.
        </p>

        <code class="code">
          const Fr端h = "foobar";
        </code>
        
        <p class="paragraph">
          But, the variable <code>fr端h</code> is not the same as <code>Fr端h</code> because JavaScript is case sensitive.
        </p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">
          In JavaScript, instructions are called <span title="A statement is a line of code commanding a task." class="title">statements</span> and are separated by semicolons (;).
        </p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">
          A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than one statement on a line is desired, then they <em>must</em> be separated by <strong>semicolons</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading__section">Comments</h2>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The syntax of <strong>comments</strong> is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:
        </p>

        <code class="code block">
          // a one line comment <br>
          /* this is a longer,
          * multi-line comment
          */
        </code>

        <p class="paragraph">
          You can't nest block comments. This often happens when you accidentally include a */ sequence in your comment, which will terminate the comment.
        </p>
