        <p class="paragraph">
          JavaScript, born in the mid-1990s, emerged as a pivotal scripting language, forever altering the landscape of web development. Conceived by Brendan Eich at Netscape, it aimed to bring interactivity to static HTML pages. Introduced in 1995 alongside Netscape Navigator 2.0, JavaScript initially faced skepticism but quickly gained traction.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Despite its name similarity with Java, the two languages share little more than syntax. JavaScript's strength lies in its ability to run directly in web browsers, enabling client-side scripting for dynamic content. Its early implementations by Netscape and Microsoft led to fragmentation, but standardization efforts, particularly the ECMAScript specification, sought to harmonize the language.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          As the internet burgeoned, JavaScript's significance soared. Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) became a game-changer, allowing seamless data exchange with servers, transforming user experiences. The rise of dynamic websites, single-page applications, and modern frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue.js underscore JavaScript's enduring relevance.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Node.js, introduced in 2009, extended JavaScript to server-side development, fostering a unified language stack. With the advent of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), JavaScript embraced modern features, enhancing its expressiveness and developer-friendliness.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          JavaScript's ubiquitous presence on the web, coupled with its adaptability and an ever-growing ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, solidifies its role as an indispensable tool in contemporary software development. From interactive web pages to robust server-side applications, JavaScript's journey epitomizes its evolution from a humble browser scripting language to a linchpin in the digital realm.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Here are some reasons to start programming with Javascript in 2024

        <h1 class="main-section-heading">A "Hello world!" example</h1>
      </header>

      <article>
        
        <p class="paragraph">
          JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As your JavaScript skills grow, your websites will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          However, getting comfortable with JavaScript is more challenging than getting comfortable with HTML and CSS. You may have to start small, and progress gradually. To begin, let's examine how to add JavaScript to your page for creating a Hello world! example. (Hello world! is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">standard for introductory programming examples.</a>)
        </p>        

        <ol class="list">

          <li class="list__Item">
            Go to your test site and create a new folder named scripts. Within the <code class="inline-code">scripts</code> folder, create a new text document called <code>main.js</code>, and save it.
          </li>

          <li class="list__Item">
            In your index.html file, enter this code on a new line, just before the closing &lt;body&gt; tag:
            <code class="block-code">
              &lt;script src="scripts/main.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
            </code>
          </li>

          <li class="list__Item">
            This is doing the same job as the &lt;link&gt; element for CSS. It applies the JavaScript to the page, so it can have an effect on the HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else on the page).
          </li>

          <li class="list__Item">
            Add this code to the <code class="inline-code">main.js</code> file:
            <code>
              const myHeading = document.querySelector("h1");
              myHeading.textContent = "Hello world!";
            </code>
          </li>

          <li class="list__Item">
            Make sure the HTML and JavaScript files are saved. Then load <code class="inline-code">index.html</code> in your browser. You should see something like this:
          </li>
        </ol>

        <img src="./assets/img/hello-world-img.jpg" alt="">

      </article>
    </section>

    <!-- Section Three -->
    <section id="header_text" class="main-section">

      <header>
        <h1 class="main-header-section">What happened?</h1>
      </header>

      <p class="paragraph">
        The heading text changed to <em>Hello world!</em> using JavaScript. You did this by using a function called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector">querySelector()</a> to grab a reference to your heading, and then store it in a variable called <code class="inline-code">myHeading</code>. This is similar to what we did using CSS selectors. When you want to do something to an element, you need to select it first.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        Following that, the code set the value of the <code class="inline-code">myHeading</code> variable's textContent property (which represents the content of the heading) to Hello world!.
      </p>

    </section>
      
    <!-- Section Four -->
    <section id="header_text" class="main-section">

        <h1 class="main-heading-section">Variables</h1>
      </header>

      <p class="paragraph">
        You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Identifier">identifiers</a>, conform to certain rules.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        A JavaScript identifier usually starts with a letter, underscore (<code class="inline-code">_</code>), or dollar sign (<code class="inline-code">$</code>). Subsequent characters can also be digits (<code class="inline-code">0</code> – <code class="inline-code">9</code>). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters <code class="inline-code">A</code> through <code class="inline-code">Z</code> (uppercase) as well as <code class="inline-code">a</code> through <code class="inline-code">z</code> (lowercase).
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        You can use most Unicode letters such as <code class="inline-code">å</code> and <code class="inline-code">ü</code> in identifiers. (For more details, see the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#identifiers">lexical grammar</a> reference.) You can also use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#string_literals">Unicode escape sequences</a> to represent characters in identifiers.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        Some examples of legal names are:
      </p>

      <ul class="list">

        <li class="list__item"><code class="inline-code">Number_hits</code></li>
        <li class="list__item"><code class="inline-code">temp99</code></li>
        <li class="list__item"><code class="inline-code">$credit</code></li>
        <li class="list__item"><code class="inline-code">_name</code></li>

    <!-- Section Five -->
    <section id="header_text" class="main-section">
      <header>
        <h1 class="main-heading-section">Declaring variables</h1>
      </header>

      <p class="paragraph">
        You can declare a variable in two ways:
      </p>

      <ul class="list">

        <li class="list__item">
          With the keyword <strong>var</strong>. For example, <code class="inline-code">var x = 42</code>. This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables, depending on the execution context.
        </li>

        <li class="list__item">
          With the keyword <strong>const</strong> or <strong>let</strong>. For example, <code class="inline-code">let y = 13</code>. This syntax can be used to declare a block-scope local variable. (See <a href="">Variable scope</a> below.)
        </li>

      </ul>

      <p class="paragraph">
        You can declare variables to unpack values using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment">destructuring assignment</a> syntax. For example, <code class="inline-code">const { bar } = foo</code>. This will create a variable named bar and assign to it the value corresponding to the key of the same name from our object <code class="inline-code">foo</code>.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        Variables should always be declared before they are used. JavaScript used to allow assigning to undeclared variables, which creates an undeclared global variable. This is an error in strict mode and should be avoided altogether.
      </p>

    </section>

    <!-- Section Six -->
    <section id="header_text" class="main-section">
      <header>
        <h1 class="main-heading-section">Declaration and initialization</h1>
      </header>

      <p class="paragraph">
        In a statement like <code class="inline-code">let x = 42</code>, the <code class="inline-code">let x</code> part is called a declaration, and the <code class="inline-code">= 42</code> part is called an initializer. The declaration allows the variable to be accessed later in code without throwing a ReferenceError, while the initializer assigns a value to the variable. In <code class="inline">var</code> and <code class="inline-code">let</code> declarations, the initializer is optional. If a variable is declared without an initializer, it is assigned the value undefined.
      </p>

      <code class="block-code">
        let x; <br>
        console.log(x); // logs "undefined"
      </code>

      <p class="paragraph">
        In essence, <code class="inline-code">let x = 42</code> is equivalent to <code class="inline-code">let x; x = 42</code>.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        <code class="inline-code">const</code> declarations always need an initializer, because they forbid any kind of assignment after declaration, and implicitly initializing it with <code class="inline-code">undefined</code> is likely a programmer mistake.
      </p>

      <code class="block-code">
        const x; // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration
      </code>

    <!-- Section Seven -->
    <section id="header_text" class="main-section">
      <header>
        <h1 class="main-heading-section">Variable scope</h1>
      </header>

      <p class="paragraph">
        A variable may belong to one of the following scopes:
      </p>

      <ul class="list">

        <li class="list__item">
          <strong>Global scope</strong>: The default scope for all code running in script mode.
        </li>

        <li class="list__item">
          <strong>Module scope</strong>: The scope for code running in module mode.
        </li>

        <li class="list__item">
          <strong>Function scope</strong>: The scope created with a function.
        </li>
      </ul>

      
      <p class="paragraph">
        In addition, variables declared with <code class="inline-code">let</code> or <code class="inline-code">const</code> can belong to an additional scope:
      </p>

      <ul class="list">
        <li class="list__item">
          <strong>Block scope</strong>: The scope created with a pair of curly braces (a block).</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="paragraph">
        When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a <em>global variable</em>, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a <em>local</em> variable, because it is available only within that function.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        <code class="inline-code">let</code> and <code class="inline-code">const</code> declarations can also be scoped to the block statement that they are declared in.
      </p>

      <code class="block-code">
        if (Math.random() > 0.5) {<br>
          const y = 5;<br>
        }
        console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
      </code>

      <p class="paragraph">
        However, variables created with <code class="inline-code">var</code> are not block-scoped, but only local to the <em>function</em> (<em>or global scope</em>) that the block resides within.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        For example, the following code will log <code class="inline-code">5</code>, because the scope of <code class="inline-code">x</code> is the global context (or the function context if the code is part of a function). The scope of <code class="inline-code">x</code> is not limited to the immediate <code class="inline-code">if</code> statement block.
      </p>

      <code class="block-code">
        if (true) {<br>
          var x = 5;<br>
        }
        console.log(x); // x is 5

    <header>
      <h1 class="main-heading-section">Variable hoisting</h1>
    </header>

      <p class="paragraph">
        var-declared variables are hoisted, meaning you can refer to the variable anywhere in its scope, even if its declaration isn't reached yet. You can see var declarations as being "lifted" to the top of its function or global scope. However, if you access a variable before it's declared, the value is always undefined, because only its declaration is hoisted, but not its initialization.
      </p>

      <code class="block-code">
        console.log(x === undefined); // true <br>
        var x = 3;<br>

        (function () {<br>
          console.log(x); // undefined <br>
          var x = "local value"; <br>
        })();
      </code>

      
      <p class="paragraph">
        The above examples will be interpreted the same as:
      </p>
      
      <code class="block-code">
      var x; <br>
      console.log(x === undefined); // true <br>
      x = 3; <br>
      
      (function () { <br>
        var x; <br>
        console.log(x); // undefined <br>
        x = "local value"; <br>
      })();
    </code>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Because of hoisting, all <code class="inline-code">var</code> statements in a function should be placed as near to the top of the function as possible. This best practice increases the clarity of the code.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Whether <code class="inline-code">let</code> and <code class="inline-code">const</code> are hoisted is a matter of definition debate. Referencing the variable in the block before the variable declaration always results in a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ReferenceError">ReferenceError</a>, because the variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until the declaration is processed.
    </p>

    <code class="block-code">
      console.log(x); // ReferenceError <br>
      const x = 3; <br>
      
      console.log(y); // ReferenceError <br>
      let y = 3;
    </code>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Unlike <code class="inline-code">var</code> declarations, which only hoist the declaration but not its value, function declarations are hoisted entirely — you can safely call the function anywhere in its scope. See the hoisting glossary entry for more discussion.

        <h1 class="main-heading-section">Global variables</h1>

      <p class="paragraph">
        Global variables are in fact properties of the <em>global object</em>.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        In web pages, the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the <code class="inline-code">window.variable</code> syntax. In all environments, you can use the globalThis variable (which itself is a global variable) to access global variables.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the <code class="inline-code">window</code> or <code class="inline-code">frame</code> name. For example, if a variable called <code class="inline-code">phoneNumber</code> is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an <code class="inline-code">iframe</code> as <code class="inline-code">parent.phoneNumber</code>.
